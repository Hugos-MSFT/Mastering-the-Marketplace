## Exercise: Review and Publish

In this short exercise you will check your work by performing the first action of the publication process. You will submit your offer for review to see if it is ready to be published.

1. In Partner Center, go to you offer in the **Marketplace offers** section.
2. Open your offer's overview page.
3. In the upper right corner of the page, click the link for **Review and publish**.
4. Looking to the right side of the page, notice that some sections have a green circle and at least one are gray. The gray sections are not yet complete, preventing you from taking the next step of publishing your offer.

> The **Technical configuration** section of the offer will not pass review. This is okay for now as we need to fill out the **Technical configuration** tab and you can't do that until we have a landing page.

5. Go back to all sections that appear with a gray circle and complete those sections.
6. Ensure all sections pass except **Technical configuration**, which will be addressed in the next lab.
